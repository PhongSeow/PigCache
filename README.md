# PigCache
#### [中文文档](https://github.com/PhongSeow/PigCache/blob/master/README.CN.md)
PigCache is a lightweight key value caching system for multiple application scenarios. It can support single process micro applications to large-scale multi server load balancing scenarios. Most scenarios do not need the support of third-party services such as memcached or Redis. The running environment can support Windows or Linux platforms. Codes in different scenarios only need to reference different class libraries, Make minor changes to the source code.

| [PigKeyCacheLib](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PigKeyCacheLib/) |        Support single process multithreaded programs         |        no need        | good             | good              | Windows and Linux | No third-party service support is required, and no fault points will be added | Only single process is supported                             |

|                                                              | Support multi process and multi thread programs under the same host |        no need        | good             | preferably        | Windows and Linux | No third-party service support is required, no fault points will be added, and multi-user process use can be supported | Can only be used on the same server                          |
| [PigKeyCacheLib.SQLServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PigKeyCacheLib.SQLServer/) |             Support multi server load balancing              |      SQL Server       | Good, scalable   | Slightly worse    | Windows Only      | This is a scenario with the best read performance and horizontal scalability. It shares database connection with applications, which is equivalent to no third-party service support, and the high availability of the database is better than redis | Poor write performance                                       |
