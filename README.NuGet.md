# PigCache
#### [中文文档](https://github.com/PhongSeow/PigCache/blob/master/README.CN.md)
PigCache is a lightweight key value caching system for multiple application scenarios. It can support single process micro applications to large-scale multi server load balancing scenarios. Most scenarios do not need the support of third-party services such as memcached or Redis. The running environment can support Windows or Linux platforms. Codes in different scenarios only need to reference different class libraries, Make minor changes to the source code.
